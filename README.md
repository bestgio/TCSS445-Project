This is a companion application geared towards the free to play game Warframe. This database application primarily serves as a guide for both new and old players on acquiring whichever items of their choosing. 

It is hosted on a Heroku server so anyone with a web browser would be able to view this database application. Note: since this application is implemented using the free tier service from Heroku, there maybe an approximately 30 second delay in first loading the application if the application is inactive within a short amount of time!

There is a search feature implemented where a user could search any item that they would like to see more information about that’s not present in the game. Not only would results of the matching search term would be listed, each result would be a link to the database for the user to easily click for more information.

Every prime item in the game could be obtained with a specific Relic. Therefore, every item in the database would have a specific Relic geared towards a certain Prime component. A user could easily click on the Relic name and be redirected in the app with where is their best chance in obtaining that Relic.

In addition, there are tabs that are present at all times when the user is browsing the app that divides all the items in the game into their own respective categories. If a user doesn’t know exactly what they’re looking for, but know the item type they’re trying to find, the tabs would be a huge convenience. Click on the categories respective tabs would query the database for all items that identify with that specific category.

A feedback system is also implemented where users can leave comments, concerns and/or suggestions about the overall app. These suggestions require a name and the comment in order to successfully insert into the database. Every comment is visible globally and there are no restrictions in the name field (name field doesn’t need to be unique). This is done so that returning users could use their same name and provide additional comments as needed.
